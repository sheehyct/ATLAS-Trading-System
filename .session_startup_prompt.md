# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-116

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-115 (February 19, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** RUNNING - CCX13 (8GB) at 178.156.223.251, dedup not yet deployed
**Plan Mode:** RECOMMENDED - Cascade/convergence architecture is multi-session effort

---

## EQUITY-115 Accomplishments

1. Implemented morning report per-symbol dedup (6 tests, pipeline.py)
2. Added _earliest_tradeable_time utility (not yet wired to output)
3. Full pipeline flow investigation via Explore agent
4. Major architectural discussion: multi-TF cascade/convergence concept
5. Captured "Where Is The Next 2" concept and morning report tiers in OpenMemory

## EQUITY-116 Priorities

### Priority 1: Convergence Architecture Planning (USE PLAN MODE)
**Context:** EQUITY-115 defined the cascade/convergence concept where inside bars on multiple higher TFs create "coiled" setups. One intraday break can flip TFC from 1/4 to 4/4. This needs careful multi-session planning.

**Key concepts to plan around:**
- "Where is the next 2" - detecting Type 1 bars on multiple TFs with converging levels
- Morning report Tier 1 (Convergence Setups), Tier 2 (Standard), Tier 3 (Continuation Context)
- Continuation patterns as TFC context (not trade candidates)
- Maps to EQUITY-113 layers: L1=context, L2=pivot finder, L3=proximity alerting
- User considering dropping 1H as trading TF (hourly = context only)

**OpenMemory refs:** 09d202cd, 733ee6f9, a976dc56

### Priority 2: Wire earliest_tradeable_time into pipeline output
**Status:** Method written but not included in candidates.json output or tests.
**Note:** May be deprioritized if 1H trading drops. Still useful as metadata.

### Priority 3: Deploy dedup to VPS
Push EQUITY-114+115 changes and restart daemon.

### Priority 4: Backtest Regression Test (carried from EQUITY-111)
Run SPY 1D backtest for a known period, validate 9 exit conditions match production daemon.

### Priority 5: Intraday Report Refreshes (design discussion)
User wants 2-3 reports per day. Morning = comprehensive, midday = lighter with fresher data.
