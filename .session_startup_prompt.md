## EQUITY-105 Priorities

### Priority 1: Verify Dashboard End-to-End
- Deploy dashboard to Railway, confirm closed trades show pattern + TFC columns populated
- Verify the full chain: VPS signal_store -> /trade_metadata API -> dashboard fetch -> display
- Check that new trades (entered after EQUITY-102 deploy) get correct TFC from writeback

### Priority 2: Port 4 Equity Fixes to Crypto Pipeline
- Stale setup validation (equity daemon.py:786-877)
- Type 3 invalidation (equity position_monitor.py:1030-1056)
- TFC re-evaluation at entry (equity daemon.py:933-1056)
- Stale 1H position detection (equity position_monitor.py:1132-1180)

### Priority 3: Desktop Migration Execution
- Copy files via flash drive to desktop
- Run agent team migration using docs/migration/MIGRATION_QUICKSTART.md prompt
- Validate with 46-check smoke test plan
