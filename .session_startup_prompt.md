# Session 83K-39 Startup: ML Gate 0 Economic Logic + Delta Optimization

**Date**: December 2025
**Previous Session**: 83K-38 (Hourly P&L Investigation + PatternType Fix)
**Status**: Ready for ML optimization work
**Plan Mode**: OFF (standard workflow)

---

## Session 83K-38 Results Summary

**Hourly P&L Investigation COMPLETE:**
- Confirmed hourly avg P&L is -$240 (not +$69 as previously reported)
- PatternType bug fixed (3-2 and 3-2-2 were mislabeled as 3-1-2)
- Hourly timeframe is NOT PROFITABLE - exclude from production

**Cross-Timeframe Hierarchy:**
| Timeframe | Avg P&L | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Monthly   | +$2,505 | BEST |
| Weekly    | +$1,086 | GOOD |
| Daily     | +$201   | GOOD |
| Hourly    | -$240   | NOT RECOMMENDED |

## Session 83K-39 Priorities

1. **Document Economic Logic for Passed Gate 0 Patterns**
   - Required before proceeding to Gate 1 ML
   - Answer 4 questions per pattern:
     1. Why does this pattern work?
     2. Who is on the other side of the trade?
     3. Why hasn't it been arbitraged away?
     4. What would cause edge to disappear?

2. **Gate 1 ML Optimization Design**
   - Focus on Daily/Weekly/Monthly ONLY (exclude hourly)
   - Approved ML: delta optimization, DTE selection, position sizing
   - Reference: `docs/exploration/ML_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_STRAT.md`

3. **Passed Gate 0 Patterns (ML Eligible)**

   | Pattern | Trades | Sharpe | Win Rate | Total P&L |
   |---------|--------|--------|----------|-----------|
   | 3-2     | 927    | 2.53   | 43.7%    | $370,691  |
   | 3-2-2   | 255    | 3.18   | 53.3%    | $78,156   |
   | 2-2     | 938    | 2.69   | 60.0%    | $235,380  |
   | 2-1-2   | 266    | 0.87   | 57.1%    | $12,899   |
