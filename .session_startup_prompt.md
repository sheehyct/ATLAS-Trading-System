# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-106

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-105 (February 11, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** DEPLOYED - No VPS changes this session (fixes need deployment)
**Plan Mode:** OFF (priorities are well-scoped bug fixes)

---

## EQUITY-105 Accomplishments

1. **Desktop Migration Executed** - Full migration from laptop (sheeh) to desktop (Chris). 44/46 validation checks passed, 2 skipped (ThetaData app, MCP in-context). Python 3.12.12, 257 packages, all MCP servers verified.
2. **VS Code Remote Tunnel** - Configured `atlas-desktop` tunnel as Windows service for anywhere access from laptop.
3. **Bug Fix: 3-? Pattern Dedup** - Fixed bidirectional patterns ("3-?") not resolving to "3-2U"/"3-2D" on entry trigger, plus cross-pattern dedup so resolved patterns are blocked when wildcard already executed.
4. **Bug Fix: EOD Exit PDT Detection** - Added PDT error detection in EOD exit retry logic with immediate Discord alerting. PDT-blocked symbols tracked to prevent retry spam across cron jobs. Grace period extended 60s -> 180s.
5. **Comprehensive Problems Audit** - Cataloged all known bugs, incomplete implementations, test failures, and technical debt across the system.

## EQUITY-106 Priorities

### Priority 1: Reset Paper Account + Deploy Fixes to VPS
- Reset Alpaca paper trading account to $100K (eliminates PDT)
- Export all open trades for MFE/MAE analysis before reset
- Deploy Bug 1 (3-? pattern) and Bug 2 (PDT detection) fixes to ATLAS VPS
- Verify EOD exits work correctly post-deployment

### Priority 2: Bug 5 - Silent Exits / Missing Discord Alerts
- HOOD trade vanished between daily audits with no exit Discord alert
- Investigate: was exit executed but alert not sent, or was position dropped?
- Check alert_manager pipeline for swallowed exceptions

### Priority 3: Position Sizing / Virtual Balance System
- Implement configurable "effective capital" for position sizing ($3K target)
- Paper account will have $100K but trades should size as if $3K cash account
- Consider T+1 settlement constraints for cash account simulation

### Priority 4: Trade Prioritization Review
- Current prioritization is not working effectively per user feedback
- Review TFC-based priority ranking, timeframe priority, signal scoring
- May need fundamental rethink of which trades get taken

## Known Bugs (from EQUITY-105 Audit)

| Bug | Status | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| 3-? Pattern Dedup | FIXED (not deployed) | Bidirectional patterns create duplicate trades |
| 1H EOD Exits | PARTIALLY FIXED (not deployed) | PDT detection added, root cause is account balance |
| Dashboard Patterns | DEFERRED | Closed trades show "Unclassified" pattern |
| TFC Not Reaching Dashboard | DEFERRED | 0/75 trades show TFC>=4, may indicate TFC detection bug |
| Silent Exits | NOT STARTED | HOOD trade exited with no Discord alert |
| Dashboard Minor Issues | DEFERRED | Various smaller display/data issues |
