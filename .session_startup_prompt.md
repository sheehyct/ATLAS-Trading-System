# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-114

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-113 (February 19, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** RUNNING - CCX13 (8GB) at 178.156.223.251, 6 bug fixes deployed
**Plan Mode:** ON - Continuation patterns and 1H timing rules need design discussion

---

## EQUITY-113 Accomplishments

1. Fixed 6 daemon bugs from VPS log analysis (hourly limit, timezone, signal_key, alerter, double-close)
2. Agent team workflow: 2 research agents -> 2 implementation agents, all parallel
3. Morning report trigger script: `scripts/trigger_morning_report.py`
4. SSH key permissions fixed (icacls), VPS deployed and verified
5. Morning report manually triggered and delivered to Discord (12 candidates, 8 setups)

## EQUITY-114 Priorities

### Priority 1: Investigate Why Only 1H Candidates in Morning Report (URGENT)
**Problem:** The morning report found 12 candidates, ALL on 1H timeframe, but:
- **2-bar patterns** (2-1-2, 3-1-2) cannot be traded until **10:30 AM ET** (need first 1H bar to close)
- **3-bar patterns** (3-2-2, 2-2-2) cannot be traded until **11:30 AM ET** (need two 1H bars to close)
- Patterns detected at 6 AM from yesterday's closed bars are **stale** by the time they're tradeable
- By 10:30-11:30 AM the setup may have already played out or invalidated

**Needed:**
- Add earliest-tradeable-time metadata to candidates based on pattern bar count
- Implement **continuation patterns** (2-2 continuations) that form intraday and can be acted on sooner
- Discuss best approach: real-time pattern detection vs. scheduled re-scans vs. hybrid
- Consider whether morning report should flag "watch for continuation" vs "ready to trade"

### Priority 2: Morning Report Quality Improvements
From first live run observations:
- **Duplicate symbols**: GOOGL x3, GOOG x3, TMUS x3 - need dedup (best setup per symbol)
- **Pipeline was NOT using 10 hardcoded symbols** (good news - it scanned 11,470 via Finviz)
- **TSLA R:R 0.88** made the cut despite being below 1.0 - review scoring thresholds
- Discord webhook was 401 on first run (fixed now) - verify tomorrow's 6 AM delivery works
- Pipeline took 17.6 minutes - consider if this is acceptable or needs optimization

### Priority 3: Backtest Regression Test (carried from EQUITY-111)
Run SPY 1D backtest for a known period, compare target/stop/time exits against existing `scripts/backtest_strat_options_unified.py`. Validates the 9 exit conditions in `strat/backtesting/` match production daemon behavior.

## Key Observations from First Morning Report

- Heavy bearish bias: 8/12 candidates PUT direction, TFC 4/4 bearish on GOOGL, GOOG, XLK, TSLA
- Only 5 unique symbols in 12 candidates (GOOGL, GOOG, XLK, TMUS, TSLA, RTX)
- All candidates 1H timeframe - no daily/weekly setups qualified
- Finviz enrichment working (sector, analyst target, news headlines attached)
