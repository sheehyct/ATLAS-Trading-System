# ATLAS STRAT Development - Session Startup

**Current Session:** 83K-74
**Last Session:** 83K-73 (December 10, 2025)
**Focus:** FOMC Volatility Monitoring - Live Entry Triggers

---

## IMMEDIATE CONTEXT: FOMC Meeting December 10, 2025

**FOMC announcement at 2:00 PM EST** - Expect volatility spikes that could trigger signals.

### Daemon Should Be Running

If not already running, start it:
```bash
uv run python scripts/signal_daemon.py start --execute
```

### Key Signals to Watch (Pre-FOMC Levels)

| Signal | Trigger | Pre-FOMC Distance | Will Execute? |
|--------|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| SPY 1D PUT | $682.59 | 0.07% above | No (low mag) |
| QQQ 1W PUT | $620.99 | 0.33% above | **YES** (1.36% mag, 1.08 R:R) |
| AAPL 1W CALL | $280.03 | 0.68% below | **YES** (3.07% mag, 2.21 R:R) |

### What to Check

1. **Daemon output** - Look for TRIGGER and ORDER SUBMITTED logs
2. **Positions** - `uv run python scripts/signal_daemon.py positions`
3. **Executions** - `cat data/executions/executions.json`

## Session 83K-73 Accomplishments

### Bug Fixed: DetectedSignal signal_key Error

- **Bug:** `_on_entry_triggered()` converted StoredSignal to DetectedSignal before passing to executor
- **Error:** `'DetectedSignal' object has no attribute 'signal_key'`
- **Fix:** Pass StoredSignal directly to executor (daemon.py:306-309)
- **Verified:** AAPL PUT triggered successfully, processed through full pipeline

### Current System State

- **Daemon:** Operational with entry monitoring working
- **Signals:** 22+ total (some TRIGGERED, others ALERTED)
- **Alpaca:** Connected (SMALL $3k equity, $6k buying power)
- **Entry Monitor:** 1-minute polling during market hours

### Note on SETUP Signal Filtering

SETUP signals have naturally low magnitude (~0.1%) because targets are very close to entry. The daemon allows these through, but executor's default filter (magnitude >= 0.5%) will SKIP them. Signals with magnitude >= 0.5% WILL execute.

## Session 83K-74 Priorities

### Priority 1: FOMC Monitoring

Monitor daemon for triggers during/after FOMC announcement. Check for:
- Triggered signals
- Executed orders
- Position status

### Priority 2: Review Results

After market close, review:
- Which signals triggered
- Which executed vs skipped
- P&L on any positions

### Priority 3: VPS Deployment

Once execution verified working, deploy to VPS for 24/7 operation.

## Quick Reference

### Key Commands

```bash
# Check daemon status
uv run python scripts/signal_daemon.py status

# Start daemon with execution
uv run python scripts/signal_daemon.py start --execute

# Scan all timeframes
uv run python scripts/signal_daemon.py scan-all

# Check positions
uv run python scripts/signal_daemon.py positions

# Check executions data
cat data/executions/executions.json
```

## Plan Mode Recommendation

**PLAN MODE: OFF**

Monitoring and VPS deployment are operational tasks. No complex implementation decisions required.
