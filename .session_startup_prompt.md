# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-57

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-56 (January 12, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** EQUITY-56 deployed, daemon running
**Plan Mode:** OFF (audit and verification tasks)

---

## EQUITY-56 Status: COMPLETE

**Three bugs fixed:**

1. **Field Name Mismatch:** Alpaca field names normalized to panel expectations
2. **TFC Calculation:** Detection timeframe now counted as aligned at entry
3. **Pattern Data:** VPS enriched_trades.json (with patterns) committed to git

**Dashboard Status:**
- P&L values: WORKING
- TFC scores: WORKING (1-4, no zeros)
- Pattern types: FIXED (VPS data committed)

---

## Priority 1: Dashboard Final Verification

Confirm Railway dashboard displays:
- Pattern column shows 2U-2D, 3-2D, 2D-2U, etc. (not "-")
- Patterns tab shows breakdown by pattern type (not "Unknown")

---

## Priority 2: Trade Entry Audit

Audit all trades entered today:

1. **Pull today's trades from Alpaca**
   ```python
   from integrations.alpaca_trading_client import AlpacaTradingClient
   client = AlpacaTradingClient()
   trades = client.get_closed_trades(after=today)
   ```

2. **For each trade, verify:**
   - Pattern is correct (pull OHLC data, classify bars manually)
   - Entry trigger was valid (price broke trigger level)
   - No STRAT entry rule violations

3. **Document any discrepancies**

---

## Priority 3: Trade Selection Logic Review

Walk through the system's trade selection flow:

1. **Pattern Detection:** `strat/paper_signal_scanner.py`
   - How symbols are scanned
   - How patterns are detected
   - Which patterns are detected (2-1-2, 3-1-2, 2-2, 3-2)

2. **Signal Filtering:** `strat/signal_automation/daemon.py`
   - TFC filtering (>= 4 threshold)
   - Stale setup validation
   - Type 3 invalidation

3. **Entry Trigger:** `strat/signal_automation/daemon.py`
   - How entry triggers are monitored
   - When entry is executed

4. **Execution:** `strat/signal_automation/executor.py`
   - Position sizing
   - Order placement
