# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-56

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-55 (January 11, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** Needs deployment of EQUITY-55 changes
**Plan Mode:** OFF (deployment and verification tasks)

---

## EQUITY-55 Completed

Retroactive TFC backfill implemented:
- Created `scripts/backfill_trade_tfc.py` (529 lines)
- Modified `dashboard/data_loaders/options_loader.py` for TFC merge
- Generated `data/enriched_trades.json` locally

**Key Finding:** All 34 historical trades had TFC < 4 (no high-TFC trades). Overall win rate: 29.4%, Total P&L: -$2,125. This supports the hypothesis that low TFC alignment correlates with poor performance.

---

## Priority 1: Deploy EQUITY-55 to VPS

```bash
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251 "cd /home/atlas/vectorbt-workspace && git pull origin main"
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251 "sudo systemctl restart atlas-daemon"
```

After deployment, run the backfill script on VPS:
```bash
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251 "cd /home/atlas/vectorbt-workspace && python scripts/backfill_trade_tfc.py --days 90"
```

---

## Priority 2: Verify New Signal TFC Population

**Goal:** Confirm signals detected after EQUITY-54 fix have non-zero tfc_score.

**Check on VPS (after market activity):**
```bash
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251 "grep 'tfc_score' /home/atlas/vectorbt-workspace/data/signals/signals.json | grep -v 'tfc_score\": 0' | head -5"
```

If no non-zero TFC scores appear, investigate further.
