---

## EQUITY-112 Accomplishments

1. Implemented pre-market morning report (6 AM ET scheduled job) with full ticker selection pipeline re-run, gap analysis, open positions, yesterday recap, capital status - sends via Discord embed
2. Added MFE/MAE excursion stats to 4:30 PM daily trade audit Discord embed (avg MFE, avg MAE, exit efficiency %, losers-went-green count)
3. Rendered capital status in daily audit embed (data was computed since EQUITY-107 but never displayed)
4. Added MorningReportConfig with env var overrides (MORNING_REPORT_ENABLED, MORNING_REPORT_HOUR, MORNING_REPORT_MINUTE)
5. 35 new tests (22 morning report + 13 audit excursion), all passing

## EQUITY-113 Priorities

### Priority 1: VPS Deployment for EQUITY-112
SSH to VPS and deploy morning report + MFE/MAE audit changes:
```bash
ssh chris@74.48.108.233
cd /home/chris/ATLAS-Trading-System && git pull
echo 'MORNING_REPORT_ENABLED=true' >> .env
sudo systemctl restart atlas-daemon
```
Verify morning report job appears in daemon logs. Monitor next 6 AM run.

### Priority 2: Backtest Regression Test (carried from EQUITY-111)
Run SPY 1D backtest for a known period, compare target/stop/time exits against existing `scripts/backtest_strat_options_unified.py`. Validates that the 9 exit conditions in `strat/backtesting/` match production daemon behavior.

### Priority 3: Dashboard or Monitoring Improvements
TBD based on what emerges from VPS monitoring of new features.
