## Priority 1: Deploy to VPS (HIGH)

```bash
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251
cd ~/vectorbt-workspace && git pull
sudo systemctl restart atlas-daemon
```

Deploy includes:
- EQUITY-61: Intrabar fix (ee3771c)
- EQUITY-62: TFC overhaul (d424891)

---

## Priority 2: Equity Prioritization (HIGH)

When multiple signals fire, rank by:
- Priority score = `ATR% * volume_ratio`
- Higher ATR% = faster moves for options
- Higher volume = better liquidity/fills

---

## Priority 3: Monitor TFC Filtering

After deployment, verify in logs:
- `FILTER REJECTED (TFC):` messages appearing
- 3-2 targets at ~1.5% (not 7%+)
- TFC evaluation includes 4H
