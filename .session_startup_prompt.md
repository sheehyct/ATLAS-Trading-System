# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-117

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-116 (February 20, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** RUNNING - CCX13 (8GB) at 178.156.223.251, EQUITY-116 deployed

---

## EQUITY-116 Accomplishments

1. Full 3-phase convergence architecture shipped (detection, pipeline, Discord)
2. New module: `strat/ticker_selection/convergence.py` (ConvergenceAnalyzer)
3. Pipeline v2.0: tiered classification (T1 convergence, T2 standard, T3 continuation)
4. Morning report shows 3 Discord sections with trigger levels
5. 54 new tests (31 convergence + 11 pipeline + 12 morning report), 224 total passing
6. 3-agent code review before commit caught and fixed proximity scoring + overflow bugs

## EQUITY-117 Priorities

### Priority 1: Live Validation of Convergence Pipeline
**Context:** Convergence system is deployed but hasn't run a live morning report yet. Trigger a pipeline run and verify Discord output shows tiered sections correctly.
**Command:** `ssh atlas@178.156.223.251 "cd ~/vectorbt-workspace && ~/.local/bin/uv run python -c \"from strat.ticker_selection.pipeline import run_selection; r = run_selection(dry_run=True); print(r['pipeline_stats'])\""`

### Priority 2: Backtest Regression Test (carried from EQUITY-111)
Run SPY 1D backtest for a known period, validate 9 exit conditions match production daemon.

### Priority 3: Intraday Report Refreshes (design discussion)
User wants 2-3 reports per day. Morning = comprehensive, midday = lighter with fresher data.

### Priority 4: Wire earliest_tradeable_time into pipeline output
Method written in EQUITY-115 but not included in candidates.json output.
