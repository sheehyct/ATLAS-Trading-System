# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-109

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-108 (February 14, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** DEPLOY PENDING - position sizing + hourly limit code pushed, needs manual SSH deploy
**Plan Mode:** OFF (testing and verification priorities)

---

## EQUITY-108 Accomplishments

1. **Reviewed and committed EQUITY-107 position sizing work** - VirtualBalanceTracker (352 lines), executor/position_monitor/daemon/config integration. Fixed critical NameError bug in executor capital reservation.
2. **Hourly entry daily limit** - `max_hourly_entries_per_day` config (-1=unlimited, 0=disabled, 1+=cap). Account 1 set to 1 in .env. 8 tests.
3. **Code simplification** - Extracted `_create_skipped_result`, class constants, `unsettled_amount` property.
4. **Railway dashboard reconnected** (by user).

## EQUITY-109 Priorities

### Priority 1: VPS Deploy (Manual)
- SSH to VPS, git pull, add `MAX_HOURLY_ENTRIES_PER_DAY=1` to .env, restart daemon
- Verify daemon starts cleanly with new capital tracker and hourly limit
- Check logs for any import errors or config issues

### Priority 2: Test Ticker Selection on Live Market Data
- Run `python scripts/run_ticker_selection.py` during market hours
- Verify: universe > 3K, screened 300-500, non-zero patterns, valid candidates.json
- Test parallel scanning performance (target: < 5 min for 100 symbols)
- Deploy to VPS as 6 AM cron job

### Priority 3: Finviz Enrichment for Daily Report
- Add Finviz integration to enrich ticker selection candidates with news/catalyst data
- Pull latest news headlines, earnings dates, analyst ratings for each candidate
- Enrich candidates.json output and Discord summary with human-readable context
- Plan ref: `curious-beaming-dawn.md` lines 332-340 (Phase 2+)

### Priority 4: Pre-Market Proximity Update (8 AM Cron)
- 8 AM ET cron job that re-checks current prices vs entry triggers from candidates.json
- Calculate updated distance-to-trigger for each candidate after overnight moves
- Send proximity report to Discord alerting on candidates near trigger range
- Plan ref: `curious-beaming-dawn.md` lines 332-340 (Phase 2+)

### Priority 5: Trade Prioritization Review
- Current prioritization not effective per user feedback
- Review TFC-based priority ranking, timeframe priority, signal scoring
- With hourly limit in place, observe which 1H trade gets selected each day

### Priority 6: Monitor Hourly Limit in Production
- After VPS deploy, check logs for 1H limit enforcement
- Assess if limit=1 is the right value or needs adjustment
