# ATLAS Development - Session Startup

**Current Session:** EQUITY-31
**Last Session:** EQUITY-30 (December 20, 2025)
**Focus:** Continue Trade Audit + Investigate Timing Filter Bypass

---

## Session EQUITY-30 Accomplishments

### STRAT Skill Major Update

User identified fundamental misunderstandings. Updated skill files:
- `~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology/SKILL.md`
- `~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology/references/ENTRY_MECHANICS.md`
- `~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology/IMPLEMENTATION-BUGS.md`

**Key Concepts Added:**

1. **Three Universal Truths** - Bar can only be 1, 2U/2D, or 3. Once boundary breaks, cannot "unbreak."
2. **Intrabar Classification** - CAN classify forming bar before close
3. **Setup vs Entry Bar** - Setup must be CLOSED, Entry classified intrabar
4. **"Let the Market Breathe"** - 1H timing: 10:30 AM (2-bar), 11:30 AM (3-bar)
5. **15:30 Bar Rule** - Must exit before 16:00

### Trade 6 Audit: GOOGL 3-2U CALL (1H) - COMPLETE

**Verdict:** INVALID TRADE - Multiple violations:
1. Entry at 09:48 (before 10:30 AM minimum)
2. Forming bar used as setup bar
3. Pattern label incorrect (3-2U vs 2D-2U)

**Unexplained:** Timing filter was implemented but trade bypassed it. Deferred investigation.

## Session EQUITY-31 Priorities

| Priority | Task |
|----------|------|
| **1. Invoke strat-methodology skill** | Mandatory for any STRAT work |
| **2. Investigate timing filter bypass** | Check Alpaca order history for actual execution times |
| **3. Continue Trade Audit** | 5 remaining trades from Dec 18-19 |

---

## Remaining Trade Audits

| Trade | Claimed Pattern | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | QQQ 3-2D-2U CALL (1W) | PENDING |
| 2 | AAPL 3-2D-2U CALL (1D) | PENDING |
| 3 | AAPL 3-2D PUT (1W) | PENDING |
| 4 | ACHR 3-2U CALL (1H) | PENDING |
| 5 | QBTS 3-2U CALL (1H) | PENDING |

## Key Concepts (from EQUITY-30)

**Three Universal Truths:**
- Scenario 1: Price stays within previous bar range -> Type 1
- Scenario 2: Price takes out ONE side (high OR low) -> Type 2U or 2D
- Scenario 3: Price takes out BOTH sides -> Type 3

**Intrabar Classification:**
- Once a boundary is broken, it cannot be "unbroken"
- A bar that breaks high is AT MINIMUM 2U (could become 3)
- A bar that breaks low is AT MINIMUM 2D (could become 3)

**"Let the Market Breathe" (1H):**
- 2-bar patterns: No entry before 10:30 AM EST
- 3-bar patterns: No entry before 11:30 AM EST
- Yesterday's last bar + today's first bar are NOT a valid pattern (overnight gap)

## Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/TRADE_AUDIT_DEC_18_19.md` | Trade audit data (Trade 6 complete) |
| `strat/signal_automation/daemon.py` | Timing filter at lines 760-801 |
| `~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology/` | Updated STRAT skill |

---

## CRITICAL: Before Writing STRAT Code

1. **Invoke strat-methodology skill** for any STRAT pattern work
2. **Query OpenMemory** for "EQUITY-30 Three Universal Truths" context
3. **Review updated skill** for intrabar classification rules

- **EQUITY-XX** - Equities STRAT options work
- **CRYPTO-XX** - Crypto derivatives work
