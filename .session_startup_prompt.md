# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-96

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-95 (January 28, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** Running - EQUITY-95 code deployed, both daemons operational
**Plan Mode:** OFF (continuation of Phase 6 work)

---

## EQUITY-95 Accomplishments

1. **EOD Exit After-Hours Bug FIXED**
   - Removed market hours bypass - all exits respect market hours
   - Changed EOD time from 15:59 to 15:55 (5-min buffer)
   - Added 4 unit tests for market hours gating

2. **Discord Audit Data Source FIXED**
   - Switched from stale paper_trades.json to Alpaca get_closed_trades()
   - Live P&L data using FIFO matching

3. **VPS Deployment + Partial Verification**
   - Stale 1H positions (IWM, NVDA) exited correctly at market open
   - Full EOD blocking verification pending (after 4 PM observation)

## EQUITY-96 Priorities

### Priority 1: Verify EOD Exit Fix (if not verified in EQUITY-95)

Check VPS logs after 4:00 PM ET from previous day:
- Should see: `Skipping exit for XXX: outside market hours (EOD)` (debug level)
- Should NOT see: repeated "Executing exit" attempts every 60 seconds

### Priority 2: Phase 6.5 - Dashboard Strategy Filter

Add strategy selector to crypto dashboard for separate P/L tracking by strategy.

### Priority 3: Code Simplification Backlog

1. Remove backward-compat delegates from crypto daemon.py (~76 lines)
2. Consolidate `_execute_trade` / `_execute_triggered_pattern` duplication (~100 lines)
