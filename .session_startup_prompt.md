# Story of Atlas Documentation Track

**Branch:** `docs/atlas-story`
**Scope:** `docs/story/` directory only - no code changes
**Target Audience:** Open source community

---

## Session Protocol

1. **Read Source Materials:**
   - `docs/session_archive/` (8 files, 50+ sessions of history)
   - `docs/archives/baseline-ma-rsi/` (why we archived an approach)
   - `docs/MASTER_FINDINGS_REPORT.md` (2,468 trades analyzed)
   - `docs/OLD_STRAT_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` (lessons from old system)

2. **Review Git History:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -50  # Major milestones
   git log --all --oneline --grep="feat" | head -20  # Features
   git log --all --oneline --grep="fix" | head -20   # Bug fixes
   ```

3. **Generate Narrative Under:** `docs/story/`

## Deliverables

```
docs/story/
  README.md                     # Main narrative (could become repo README)
  01_INCEPTION.md               # Why we started, initial goals, vision
  02_ARCHITECTURE_EVOLUTION.md  # Key design decisions, pivots, trade-offs
  03_WHAT_WORKED.md             # Victories, successful patterns, validations
  04_WHAT_DIDNT.md              # Failures, archived approaches, lessons
  05_RESEARCH_DEEP_DIVES.md     # Technical details, academic foundations
  06_LESSONS_LEARNED.md         # Advice for others building trading systems
```

## Narrative Guidelines

**Tone:** Professional but accessible, honest about failures, educational

**Structure per chapter:**
1. Context (why this matters)
2. The journey (what happened)
3. Key decisions (what we chose and why)
4. Outcomes (what resulted)
5. Takeaways (what to remember)

**Include:**
- Specific dates and session numbers where possible
- Code snippets that illustrate decisions
- Performance metrics that validated approaches
- Links to relevant source files

**Avoid:**
- Marketing language
- Overpromising results
- Hiding failures (they are educational)
