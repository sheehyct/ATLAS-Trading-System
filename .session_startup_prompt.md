**Previous Session:** EQUITY-64 (January 15, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** DEPLOYED (1H bar alignment fix from EQUITY-64)
**Plan Mode:** OPTIONAL - No critical issues pending

## EQUITY-64 Accomplishments

1. **1H Bar Alignment Fix** (6eb9ef8): Added `_fetch_hourly_market_aligned()` method
   that fetches 1Min data and resamples with `offset='30min'` for market-open alignment.
   - Bars now show 9:30, 10:30, 11:30 instead of 10:00, 11:00, 12:00
   - TFC evaluation uses correctly aligned bars
   - Verification script confirms 100% alignment

2. **Audit Completed:**
   - Direct 1H fetch: FIXED
   - TFC evaluation: FIXED (uses _fetch_data which is now correct)
   - Resampled scans: Already working (uses _resample_to_htf)
   - Crypto pipeline: Not affected (uses Coinbase API, UTC-aligned correct for 24/7)

## EQUITY-65 Priorities

### Priority 1: Stale Setup Filter Fix for 3-? Patterns (MEDIUM)

From EQUITY-62 investigation: 3-? patterns have entry AFTER setup bar closes.
Stale filter rejected valid 10:47 trigger as "stale" (setup bar was 9:30).

### Priority 2: Discord Alert Delay Investigation (LOW)

From EQUITY-62: Discord alerts delayed ~1 hour. Investigate cause.

### Priority 3: Monitor 1H Pattern Detection (VERIFICATION)

Monitor live 1H pattern detection after EQUITY-64 fix to verify:
- Bar timestamps show :30 (9:30, 10:30, 11:30)
- Pattern classifications match TradingView
- TFC scores are accurate
