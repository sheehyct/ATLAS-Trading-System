**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** RUNNING - Fresh CCX13 (8GB RAM) deployed at 178.156.223.251, daemon healthy
**Plan Mode:** ON - Pipeline universe expansion requires investigation

2. Added MFE/MAE excursion stats + capital rendering to 4:30 PM daily audit Discord embed
3. Fresh VPS deployment (CCX13 8GB) - all EQUITY-108 through EQUITY-112 changes now live
4. SSH key auth working from Claude Code to VPS (root@178.156.223.251)
5. 35 new tests (22 morning report + 13 audit excursion)

## EQUITY-113 Priorities

### Priority 1: Morning Report Pipeline Universe Expansion
The morning report currently uses the daemon's SIGNAL_SYMBOLS (10 hardcoded tickers). It should use the full ticker selection pipeline with Finviz enrichment (EQUITY-109) to scan a broader universe. Investigate `strat/ticker_selection/pipeline.py` and wire the Finviz screener as the universe source for the morning report.

### Priority 2: Monitor Morning Report at 6 AM ET
First live run of the morning report. Check Discord for the embed, review content quality (patterns, TFC scores, gaps). Verify pipeline completes within acceptable time on VPS.

### Priority 3: Backtest Regression Test (carried from EQUITY-111)
Run SPY 1D backtest for a known period, compare target/stop/time exits against existing `scripts/backtest_strat_options_unified.py`. Validates the 9 exit conditions in `strat/backtesting/` match production daemon behavior.
