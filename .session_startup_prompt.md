# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-107

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-106 (February 12, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** DEPLOYED - $100K account, all bug fixes live
**Plan Mode:** OFF (priorities are implementation tasks)
**Parallel Work:** User may have dynamic ticker selection changes in working tree

---

## EQUITY-106 Accomplishments

1. **Paper Account Reset to $100K** - Exported 138 fills + 75 closed trades before reset. New API keys configured locally, VPS, and Railway. PDT eliminated.
2. **VPS Deployment** - Deployed 3-? pattern dedup, EOD PDT detection, and silent exits fix. Daemon running clean on new account.
3. **Bug Fix: Silent Exits** - Root cause: sync_positions silently removed positions that disappeared from Alpaca (no callback, no Discord alert). Also stale 1H exits blocked pre-market by market hours gate, causing race with sync. Fixed both.
4. **Code Simplification** - Extracted _handle_external_close method, simplified pre-market time check.

## EQUITY-107 Priorities

### Priority 1: Position Sizing / Virtual Balance System
- Implement configurable "effective capital" for position sizing ($3K target)
- Paper account has $100K but trades should size as if $3K cash account
- Consider T+1 settlement constraints for cash account simulation
- Current: max_capital_per_trade=$300 in executor.py:135

### Priority 2: Trade Prioritization Review
- Current prioritization is not working effectively per user feedback
- Review TFC-based priority ranking, timeframe priority, signal scoring
- May need fundamental rethink of which trades get taken

### Priority 3: Railway Dashboard Reconnection
- Railway lost GitHub repo connection (accidental removal)
- Need to reconnect Railway to sheehyct/ATLAS-Trading-System repo
- Dashboard env vars already updated with new Alpaca keys

### Priority 4: Remaining Bugs (Deferred)
- Dashboard patterns show "Unclassified" (data transfer issue)
- TFC not reaching dashboard (0/75 trades show TFC>=4)
- Dashboard minor display issues
