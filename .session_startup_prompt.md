**VPS Status:** Unknown - verify commit 98d8a2c deployed
**Plan Mode:** OFF (normal development)

## EQUITY-99 Accomplishments

1. **Spot Signal Detection + Derivative Execution Architecture** - Implemented two-layer data system where spot data (BTC-USD) is used for pattern detection and derivative (BIP-20DEC30-CDE) for execution
2. **SymbolResolver Utility** - Created new crypto/utils/symbol_resolver.py with mapping utilities
3. **Scanner/Monitor/Daemon Integration** - Modified signal_scanner, entry_monitor, and daemon to use spot data when available
4. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - 40 unit tests + 19 integration tests for spot/derivative flow
5. **StatArb Compatibility** - ADA/XRP continue using derivative data unchanged (no spot available)

## EQUITY-100 Priorities

### Priority 1: VPS Deployment Verification
Verify VPS has commit 98d8a2c (fee profitability filter + deadline handling) deployed:
```bash
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251 "cd ~/vectorbt-workspace && git log -1 --oneline"
```
Pull and restart if needed.

### Priority 2: Dashboard TradingView Charts Fix
The TradingView charts tab is broken in the manual trading dashboard. Investigate with Playwright and fix.

### Priority 3: Monitor Spot/Derivative Architecture
Watch daemon logs for spot data usage in signal detection. Verify cleaner price action in CFM signals.
