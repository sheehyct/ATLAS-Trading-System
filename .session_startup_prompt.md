## EQUITY-102 Priorities

### Priority 1: Fix Signal-to-Trade Metadata Correlation
Dashboard shows ALL trades as "Unclassified" pattern and "No" TFC continuity.
- Investigate why signal_store data is not reaching closed trades view
- The correlation between Alpaca trades and signal_store signals is broken
- Without this, we cannot validate strategy effectiveness

### Priority 2: Backfill Historical Trades
- Use Alpaca order log + signal_store to populate pattern/TFC for closed trades
- Calculate MFE/MAE from historical 1-min underlying price data
- This serves as diagnostic tool to expose remaining entry/exit bugs

### Priority 3: Port 4 Equity Fixes to Crypto Pipeline
- Stale setup validation (equity daemon.py:786-877)
- Type 3 invalidation (equity position_monitor.py:1030-1056)
- TFC re-evaluation at entry (equity daemon.py:933-1056)
- Stale 1H position detection (equity position_monitor.py:1132-1180)
