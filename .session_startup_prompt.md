# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-104

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-103 (February 8, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** DEPLOYED - Daemon running, /trade_metadata API serving 110 entries, backfill complete
**Plan Mode:** OFF (next priorities are well-scoped)

---

## EQUITY-103 Accomplishments

1. **Historical Trade Backfill** - Extended backfill_trade_tfc.py with two-tier signal matching (94.4% match rate, 51/54 trades matched), smart TFC reuse (51 signal store, 3 retroactive), trade_metadata.json output
2. **`/trade_metadata` on Signal API** - Added endpoint to signal_api.py (the actual VPS API server), fixing 404 that blocked dashboard metadata fetches
3. **Deployed and Verified** - Ran backfill on VPS, confirmed API returns 110 entries with 108/110 having patterns and 57/110 having TFC scores
4. **Code Simplification** - Extracted timezone normalization helper, named constants for magic numbers, decomposed signal_api.py route into helpers

## EQUITY-104 Priorities

### Priority 1: Verify Dashboard End-to-End
- Deploy dashboard to Railway, confirm closed trades show pattern + TFC columns populated
- Verify the full chain: VPS signal_store -> /trade_metadata API -> dashboard fetch -> display
- Check that new trades (entered after EQUITY-102 deploy) get correct TFC from writeback

### Priority 2: Port 4 Equity Fixes to Crypto Pipeline
- Stale setup validation (equity daemon.py:786-877)
- Type 3 invalidation (equity position_monitor.py:1030-1056)
- TFC re-evaluation at entry (equity daemon.py:933-1056)
- Stale 1H position detection (equity position_monitor.py:1132-1180)

### Priority 3: Trade Analytics Deep Dive
- Analyze pattern performance by type (3-2D, 3-2U, 2D-2U, etc.)
- Investigate TFC >= 4 having lower win rate but positive P&L (larger winners?)
- Consider adding pattern-based position sizing or filtering
