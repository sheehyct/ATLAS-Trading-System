## Session 83K-80 Priorities

### CRITICAL: Higher Timeframe Scanning Architecture Fix

**Problem Discovered (Session 83K-79):**
- Daily scans at 5 PM, Weekly Friday 6 PM, Monthly on 28th
- SETUP patterns (2-1-?, 3-1-?) trigger LIVE when price breaks inside bar
- Scanning monthly only on 28th = missing 4 weeks of entries
- Move is OVER by the time we detect the setup

**Proposed Solution:**
Use hourly scan to resample/check "running" higher TF bars:
```
Hourly Scan (every :30)
    |-- Scan 1H bars directly
    |-- Resample to "running" Daily (9:30 open -> now)
    |-- Resample to "running" Weekly (Monday open -> now)
    |-- Resample to "running" Monthly (1st trading day -> now)
    |-- Detect SETUPS on ALL timeframes
    |-- Entry monitor watches for LIVE triggers
```

**CRITICAL: STRAT Methodology Skill Required**
Location: `~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology/`
- PATTERNS.md: Bar classification, pattern detection
- EXECUTION.md: "Entry is LIVE when current bar breaks inside bar bound"
- Must invoke skill before implementation

### Secondary Priorities

1. Monitor Live Trading - Discord alerts with 11 symbols
2. VPS Check - Verify daemon running
3. Optional: Scripts cleanup when maintenance window available

## VPS Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Signal Daemon | RUNNING | 11 symbols active |
| Signal API | RUNNING | Port 5000 |
| Dashboard | AUTO-DEPLOYED | Railway |

## VPS Commands

```bash
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251

# Check status
sudo systemctl status atlas-daemon
sudo journalctl -u atlas-daemon -f

# Restart if needed
sudo systemctl restart atlas-daemon
```

## Plan Mode Recommendation

**PLAN MODE: ON** - Higher timeframe scanning architecture requires careful planning.
