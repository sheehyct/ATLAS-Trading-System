## EQUITY-80 Priorities

### Priority 1: Continue Test Coverage

Remaining untested modules:
- Any other gaps identified during audit
- Consider parametrizing existing tests per code-simplifier recommendations

### Priority 2: Monitor 3-? Target Fix

Verify AMD and future 3-?/3-2 trades exit correctly at 1.5% target.
Note: Index 1.5% targets may need future adjustment (indices rarely move 1.5% on 1H patterns).

### Priority 3: Clean Up Technical Debt

- Review uncommitted docs in docs/ folder
- Consider archiving older HANDOFF sessions if approaching 1500 lines

- CLAUDE.md: `docs/CLAUDE.md` (STRICT COMPLIANCE)
