# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-113

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-112 (February 18, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** RUNNING - Fresh CCX13 (8GB RAM) deployed at 178.156.223.251, daemon healthy
**Plan Mode:** ON - Continuation patterns and 1H timing rules need design discussion

---

## EQUITY-112 Accomplishments

1. Implemented pre-market morning report (6 AM ET) with pipeline, gap analysis, positions, recap, capital
2. Added MFE/MAE excursion stats + capital rendering to 4:30 PM daily audit Discord embed
3. Fresh VPS deployment (CCX13 8GB) - all EQUITY-108 through EQUITY-112 changes now live
4. SSH key auth working from Claude Code to VPS (root@178.156.223.251)
5. Discord webhooks fixed (old ones mangled by Hetzner console font, new Daily Alerts channel created)
6. First morning report ran: 11,470 universe -> 500 screened -> 385 patterns -> 12 candidates

## EQUITY-113 Priorities

### Priority 1: 1H Candidate Timing Rules + Continuation Patterns (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** The morning report found 12 candidates, ALL on 1H timeframe, but:
- **2-bar patterns** (2-1-2, 3-1-2) cannot be traded until **10:30 AM ET** (need first 1H bar to close)
- **3-bar patterns** (3-2-2, 2-2-2) cannot be traded until **11:30 AM ET** (need two 1H bars to close)
- Patterns detected at 6 AM from yesterday's closed bars are **stale** by the time they're tradeable
- By 10:30-11:30 AM the setup may have already played out or invalidated

**Needed:**
- Add earliest-tradeable-time metadata to candidates based on pattern bar count
- Implement **continuation patterns** (2-2 continuations) that form intraday and can be acted on sooner
- Discuss best approach: real-time pattern detection vs. scheduled re-scans vs. hybrid
- Consider whether morning report should flag "watch for continuation" vs "ready to trade"

### Priority 2: Morning Report Quality Improvements
From first live run observations:
- **Duplicate symbols**: GOOGL x3, GOOG x3, TMUS x3 - need dedup (best setup per symbol)
- **Pipeline was NOT using 10 hardcoded symbols** (good news - it scanned 11,470 via Finviz)
- **TSLA R:R 0.88** made the cut despite being below 1.0 - review scoring thresholds
- Discord webhook was 401 on first run (fixed now) - verify tomorrow's 6 AM delivery works
- Pipeline took 17.6 minutes - consider if this is acceptable or needs optimization

### Priority 3: Backtest Regression Test (carried from EQUITY-111)
Run SPY 1D backtest for a known period, compare target/stop/time exits against existing `scripts/backtest_strat_options_unified.py`. Validates the 9 exit conditions in `strat/backtesting/` match production daemon behavior.

## Key Observations from First Morning Report

- Heavy bearish bias: 8/12 candidates PUT direction, TFC 4/4 bearish on GOOGL, GOOG, XLK, TSLA
- Only 5 unique symbols in 12 candidates (GOOGL, GOOG, XLK, TMUS, TSLA, RTX)
- All candidates 1H timeframe - no daily/weekly setups qualified
- Finviz enrichment working (sector, analyst target, news headlines attached)
