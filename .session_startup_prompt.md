## Session 83K-77 Accomplishments

### CRITICAL BUG FIXED - Rapid Entry/Exit (DEPLOYED TO VPS)

**Four Safeguards Implemented:**

| Fix | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| 1. Minimum Hold Time | 5-minute hold before exit checks |
| 2. HISTORICAL_TRIGGERED Check | Skip completed patterns |
| 3. Thread-Safe Lock | Prevent concurrent duplicate execution |
| 4. Market Hours Check | Skip exits outside 9:30-4:00 ET |

### Discord Alerts Simplified (DEPLOYED TO VPS)

Discord now only sends clean, mobile-friendly trade alerts:

**Entry:** `Entry: SPY 3-1-2U 1D Call @ $670 | Target: $690 | Stop: $665`
**Exit:** `Exit: SPY 3-1-2U 1D Call | Target Hit | P/L: +$325`

No more daemon status, scan summaries, or signal detection alerts.

### VPS Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Signal Daemon | RUNNING | Bug fixes + Discord alerts deployed |
| Signal API | RUNNING | Port 5000 |
| Discord Webhook | CONFIGURED | Entry/exit alerts only |

## Session 83K-78 Priorities

### Priority 1: Dashboard Enhancement

Add pattern trigger time to Options Trade Section:
- Show when the pattern became active/triggered
- Display in signal table on dashboard

### Priority 2: Verify Pattern Accuracy

Review trades that were NOT entered due to low magnitude:
- Check if pattern detection was accurate
- Verify entry/target/stop prices match STRAT methodology
- Assess if magnitude filter is appropriate

### Priority 3: Monitor Live Trading

- Watch for Discord alerts on new entries/exits
- Verify 5-minute minimum hold time is working
- Check logs for any issues

## Future Sessions (Post-Monitoring Phase)

### Comprehensive Project Audit
1. System architecture documentation
2. README.md updates
3. Analysis of current strategies vs planned strategies
4. Clean up any technical debt

### Potential New Strategy
- Leveraged crypto derivatives strategy
- Benefits: No theta decay, small account friendly
- Possibilities: Arbitrage, simple STRAT with leverage
