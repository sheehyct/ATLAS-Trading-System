# Session Startup Prompt - EQUITY-112

**Previous Session:** EQUITY-111 (February 17, 2026)
**Current Branch:** `main`
**VPS Status:** RUNNING (healthy, 4+ days uptime) - Finviz enrichment still needs SSH deploy
**Plan Mode:** ON - New feature implementation (morning report + MFE/MAE integration)

---

## EQUITY-111 Accomplishments

1. Cloned `strat-stock-scanner` MCP repo to desktop, configured with Alpaca keys
2. Fixed pre/post-market quote failure: switched default feed from IEX to SIP (Algo Trader Plus), config-driven feed selection across all endpoints
3. Ported 3 TFC enhancements from workspace: bar-type-only directional classification, bidirectional counts, timeframe-appropriate contextual scoring
4. Added `get_snapshot()` endpoint, session metadata (pre-market/regular/post-market) in quote responses, rate limits updated to 9000/min
5. VPS verified healthy (Presidents' Day, no scans ran) - confirmed NO morning report job exists in daemon

## EQUITY-112 Priorities

### Priority 1: Pre-Market Morning Report
Design and implement a morning report scheduled job for the daemon. Should run at ~6:00 AM ET and include:
- Overnight STRAT setups (which patterns are ready for breakout)
- Pre-market gap analysis
- TFC alignment scoring for the day
- Send via Discord webhook

### Priority 2: MFE/MAE Integration with Daily Trade Audit
Apply the MFE (Maximum Favorable Excursion) / MAE (Maximum Adverse Excursion) implementation to the existing Daily Trade Audit (4:30 PM ET job). This enriches P&L reporting with how far trades moved in favor/against before exit.

### Priority 3: Backtest Regression Test (carried from EQUITY-111)
Run new backtest on SPY 1D for a known period, compare target/stop/time exits against existing `scripts/backtest_strat_options_unified.py`.
