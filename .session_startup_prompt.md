## EQUITY-98 Priorities

### Priority 1: Verify EOD Exit Fix (VPS)
Check VPS logs after market close to confirm EOD exits are blocked outside market hours (commit cd87f19 from EQUITY-95). VPS payment issue should be resolved.

### Priority 2: Dashboard Trade Analytics Tab
Add MFE/MAE visualization to dashboard:
- Exit efficiency chart (how much profit captured vs available)
- Pattern performance breakdown with MFE/MAE metrics
- Trade-by-trade excursion analysis

### Priority 3: Analytics Deep Dive Scripts
Create analysis scripts to answer:
- Which patterns leave money on table? (low exit efficiency)
- What's the typical MAE before recovery for winners?
- Optimal stop placement based on historical MAE
