## DB-5 Priorities

### Priority 1: Code Simplification (from DB-4 review)
- Extract `_stat_card()` helper from `_create_stats_cards()` (~70 lines saved)
- Consolidate empty chart placeholders in `_create_equity_chart()`

### Priority 2: DARK_THEME Unification
- Local DARK_THEME dict in strat_analytics_panel.py doesn't match config.py COLORS
- Refactor to use centralized COLORS dict

### Priority 3: Account Selector Persistence
- Use `dcc.Store` to persist selector state across tab switches

### Priority 4: Strategy Performance Tab Polish
- Ensure all strategy types render correctly
- Connection error handling
