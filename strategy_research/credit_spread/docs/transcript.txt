here, a lot of constructive comments, a plethora of different backgrounds, different experience levels, and I think we've all gelled very well together and have made something that is actually quite special and something that I'm very proud of. And I think we all should be as well because we're all making it what it is. And you know when I think that it's a free community, often when you see free communities or free discords they're all just riddled with spam, but actually I haven't got a single moderator. Yeah we've got some volunteers that help with some of the posting, but haven't got a single moderator and really and truly everyone is extremely respectful and adds a lot of value. So yeah, many thanks for that. Quick update actually on the data platform. So what you guys are seeing with my posts and the posts of the volunteers is basically still just a beta mode of the data platform which focuses on the Delta and Gamma charts. That's pretty much ready. There are some improvements that we can make in terms of the front end, but the reason for the delay is actually that I'm working closely with the guy who's helping me with the website from a coding perspective in order to basically make it much much more than what you've seen. So what you're seeing there is essentially just positioning charts, but I want this to be like an unusual Wells type platform where you've got institutional flow, you can see the institutional holdings, you can see analyst ratings, you can see financial metrics, you can see valuation metrics, you can see news. Basically a place where you can do all of your stock related research and you know diving into the different stocks that you're interested in or stocks that you're holding and I want to do all of that and deliver it to you for essentially free. So you know that is taking a little bit of time, but we are we are definitely making progress and hopefully I'm hoping that you know in the next couple of months hopefully before then, but that's the sort of realistic perhaps deadline that I'm trying to give to the project that will have absolutely something there for you that will be something that you can absolutely use and will be of great value. We will hopefully try and release something for the community that's you know perhaps a bit more simplistic than what the final outcome will be so that you can get actually inside the data platform and start using it and hopefully that will be sooner in the new year. But yeah I appreciate your patience and I promise you that we are working on something that will be extremely effective. So obviously normally my medium of communication is writing, this time I'm going for video. I'm a bit nervous about that actually to be honest, but the reason why I'm going for video is because I feel as though what I'm about to explain will be much more easily understood and absorbed just through you being able to see what's happening on the screen and yeah like what I'm trying to do with this video is that I know that there's a great proportion of the community who have done all of the school of tiers trading school educational course from the site and they are trading the breakouts and everything is going really well and then there's obviously a section of the site and I'm very aware there's a section of the community where things are not going quite so successfully and perhaps you're feeling a little bit despondent or you're thinking that perhaps this is not for you. Well this video actually is it's aimed for everybody because it's going to be extremely beneficial and constructive for everyone but particularly so those who are potentially struggling with some of the active side of trading because I want you to understand that first of all trading does not need to be a full-time commitment in terms of time. This strategy I'm going to tell you is quite passive and definitely fits with the lifestyle of even the hardest working professional and furthermore it's actually something that you know it's quite simple so even someone who's struggling with the active side of trading and you might think oh I absolutely suck at trading this is not for me I should probably just give markets a break. This strategy is definitely something that you'll be able to do and it will deliver you extremely strong results over the course of like a prolonged period of time. This is not like the sort of strategy that's going to take you from 10k to a million in a year but this is the sort of strategy and everything that I try and teach actually is the sort of approach where over the course of a period of time it will bring you and your family closer to you know where you want to be financially and yeah that's the sort of aim of everything that I'm trying to do and this strategy I think will very easily take you there so I don't think that anyone needs to resign themselves to just having to invest in you know the S&P 500 and accept a 10% return per year because that's not particularly great to be honest and you can definitely do a lot better than that even if you feel as though some of the things that I've taught so far with regards to the breakout trading or positioning charts or following the institutional flow it's not working for you this will so yeah take some hope from this and and hopefully it will it will work well for you. I know that you know everyone is expecting me to deliver an educational video on the rule-based strategy that I mentioned last week and whilst I'm going to touch on that that's surprisingly actually not what I'm going to focus on today because I think that there is something that's better something that will deliver better results or have less stressful drawdowns and will ultimately be a much more pleasant trading experience and so I'm going to focus on that after I touch upon the rule-based strategy and I'm going to explain exactly why I'm suggesting that people in the community follow this strategy that I'm about to put out to you and I've actually if you've seen deleted some of the posts on the rule-based strategy and that was deliberately so because I want you to follow this strategy rather than that one because I think it's just going to be much easier for you. So first of all just clarifying something about the post that I made on the rule-based strategy so on Reddit in particular less so for the community but on Reddit in particular I made the title of the post something which was admittedly quite clickbaity where I said that you know I deliver 70% return per year across the last 10 years and you know I did get quite a few negative comments on the post where they basically said of 70% return per year that's impossible because what they've done is they've calculated that you know I'm compounding 70% each and every year and they've calculated that you know if you started with 10,000 pounds after 10 years you'd be at two and a half million pounds and they're like that's impossible and that's actually not what I've done when I've calculated that so what I've done in order to draw that number was a slight manipulation of the numbers to be honest for the sake of being able to put a title out there that will attract attention and draw you know engagement to the post but what I did is that if you started with 10,000 pounds and then after 10 years you had 80,000 pounds and that would be a 700% return so then what I did is I took that 700% return and divided it by 10 because there are 10 years which gave 70% per year obviously that's not actually how you calculate annualized returns nor is it how you calculate average returns but it's just the fudging of numbers that I did deliberately in order to basically make the post more attractive or at least the title of the post more attractive for the feed and it worked to be honest I mean that post got millions of hits which is great for the community but that's just me on a transparency note just telling you where that number came about now the strategy is a rule-based strategy that focuses on leveraged ETFs now you can get leveraged ETFs that are 3x of S&P 500 you can get leveraged ETFs actually of different things as well like SOX L which is a leveraged ETF of SMH which is a semiconductor ETF you can get leveraged ETFs of QQQ as well what the strategy focuses on is the leveraged ETF of the S&P 500 the reason why I chose the S&P 500 and backtested it is basically due to the fact that S&P 500 in my opinion is the most diversified so if you look at QQQ obviously it's a heavy tech focus predominantly driven by the mega cap tech stocks whereas S&P 500 obviously has exposure to health care oil industrials and it's just a more diversified index which I thought that would be you know a safer investment over the long term when you consider that you know tech can go into like bear markets and semis can go into bear markets which can obviously drive tech down I just thought that you know S&P 500 was probably the best and most diverse index to base the leverage off now with the leveraged ETFs you can get 3x leverage you can get 2x leverage I think you can even get 10x leverage but obviously that would be extremely dangerous so the the post previously focused on SPXL there are other providers of the same essential ETF like you pro and SSO is


2x ETF but it is still along the same lines. Now as I mentioned the post that I made before on the rule-based strategy I am actually explicitly advising people not to follow which sounds crazy but as I mentioned I've got something better for you but the reason why that is is because as I also mentioned in an announcement afterwards I had made a couple of simplifications to that post for the sake of making it easy because it was already 15,000 words or it was something crazy like that. Now the buying rules were all pretty much as they are that you should be looking for the first trigger 15% down from the local high and then you scale the position in starting with 20% down then when it drops another 10% you scale another 15% of your portfolio in and then you build it up like that but the selling rule was something that I simplified quite a lot and I actually went back and looked at exactly what the selling rules were that I actually followed over the course of the last 10 years and it was quite a lot more complex actually than what I put into that post. I knew that I was simplifying it quite a bit but when I went back and looked at the rules I really spent some time and thought about it and you see the thing is for me for this community my primary goal is for you to be able to trade successfully and have a positive experience with trading and to be able to do it absolutely without me and the thing is with the selling rules that I actually used they are quite complex. Yeah you will probably after spending some time be able to get your head around them but they were more complex than what I think trading needs to be. For an absolute beginner there's no reason why it needs to go over your head or confuse you or leave any scope for mistake because obviously when you're playing with leverage in particular if you make a mistake with the rules because you misunderstood something it's just going to be very dangerous so for that reason I'm explicitly advising not to follow this. I mean the rules that I actually put out I have on the right hand side there that basically look if you have three of the positions down so you've invested 20 percent and then you've added another 15 and then you've added another 20 you should be looking to sell for a 20 profit on your average price but you should leave five percent of the position to run with a trailing stop loss where you're looking to add another 17 and if you can't achieve 17 because it does a correction before it reaches 17 then set a trailing stop loss at 11 down from the high. Now if you've actually invested more than three positions and you're down to your fourth position so you're somewhere around here now in my opinion this is like too heavily invested you've now invested what is 75 percent of your entire portfolio into a leveraged instrument that's more than I'm comfortable with to be honest so that's why I scaled the expectation of what I was looking for from the trade down so I'm now no longer looking for 20 percent out of the trade I'm looking for just a 10 percent gain on my average price and you can still leave some running there to try and achieve the 20 percent but yeah you're looking for much less and if you find yourself fully invested well now I'm obviously quite uncomfortable you know I'm sort of a little bit stressed now I've got all my money invested into a leveraged fund so at that point I'm just looking for five percent out of the trade and you know I would then take quite a lot of the position out and leave some of the position running on a trailing stop loss to try and catch any additional upside now that may make sense I've simplified it further there I mean if you look on the right hand side that's actually the real rules there in my explanation verbally to you now I've simplified it a little bit again but it's just in my opinion a bit too complex there are a couple of other downfalls that I'm seeing now the the other one the main one is the severity of the drawdowns now by the time you get fully invested SPXL or the leveraged ETF is going to be down like 50 percent from its highs but your average position is still going to be down around 35 percent so you're telling me that your entire position your entire portfolio is invested but it's already down 35 percent and then if SPXL continues to go lower you might find your entire portfolio is down 50 percent now I did find myself in that position many times over the last few years particularly so in 2022 and it it wasn't the most pleasant experience but I mean I have fortitude in my mental thinking that I was able to ride that out and still stick to the rules and you know come out of it fine it helped that 2022 had a lot of large bear market bounces and that 2023 was a strong rally and recovery but in all honesty I don't want you to find yourself in a situation where you're 50 percent down on all your money and you played all your cards and that you've invested all of your funds and now you have to sit and wait because all that's going to happen is you're going to be cursing tier for sending you on this stupid strategy and I don't want you to have that experience you know that saying that I think Mike Tyson said that everyone has a plan until they're punched in the face like it I draw a similarity here that you have a set of rules but when you're down 50 percent of your entire portfolio maybe they go out the window and maybe you make a mistake maybe you get emotional maybe it's a bit too tough for you so I don't want to leave any scope open for that because it's your hard-earned money and I don't want to be responsible for making you feel stressed first of all and potentially making a mistake with the strategy due to that stress which leaves you with a loss and it would be a large loss too so for that reason I'm also suggesting not to follow the strategy that I put out because the drawdowns are too large. The other reason why I'm suggesting not to is because I used this strategy over the last 10 years but you have to remember that the 10 years that I used it was essentially a bull market where the drawdowns were not too large and they tended to bounce quite quickly. Now I have backtested this through 2008 and it does work but it is a lot more stressful as well and you find your portfolio down quite a bit and actually I think at one point when I backtested it I realized that I would have to deviate a little bit from the rules in order to make it work. Now the thing is is that in all honesty I'm a professional at this and I feel confident in my ability to be able to manage the drawdown and to be able to manage the stress if I have to deviate from the rules but I'm not saying that everybody is going to be in that level of confidence. You might be a beginner and not have the expertise to be able to deal with that and if I'm not there to guide you I don't want you to be in a situation where you can't deal with whatever situation you're faced with so in all honesty there's a better way to do this and it actually yields better results, it's less stressful, it has fewer drawdowns and it more appropriately uses the leverage since you basically capitalize on uptrends rather than trying to scale into downtrends which is actually probably not the ideal way to use leverage. As I mentioned it's worked well for me but in all honesty I do realize that in a prolonged bear market like you got in 2008 it could run into some issues. Fortunately I haven't actually had to experience that but I'm obviously trying to cover all bases before I put something out to the community in good faith that it's going to work and then people use it and god forbid we find ourselves in that situation in a few years time, I don't want to feel responsible for any issues there. So what I'm putting out to you today is a different strategy but it's more effective and is in most ways to be honest with you better. I'm calling it tiers credit spreads leverage ETF strategy and again we're going to be using SPXL or UPRO or SSO so using a leveraged instrument of SPX. So the reason why I like that is because it mitigates single stock risk so you can imagine the scenario where you've invested into something or you've put your money into a stock like AMD this year and actually semiconductors have done well, Broadcom's done well, NVIDIA's done well, Marvel's done well but AMD just hasn't so you put your money into something that's just massively underperformed the market. Obviously we want to reduce the risk that you can do that and investing into the S&P 500 due to the diversification or in this case a leveraged instrument of the S&P 500 basically helps you to mitigate that. Furthermore SPXL would basically help you to benefit from that diversification but still be able to capitalize on the magnified gains so S&P moves quite slowly it has a very average beta but if you have a leveraged product then you get a lot more volatility there you can buy dips that are more pronounced and be able to ride the recovery and make a greater return so yeah like how SPXL works is like the mechanism of it is that it multiplies the daily return in S&P by three. If you were using SSO it would be multiplying the daily return in S&P by two. Now you might think to yourself okay well I know that S&P sort of delivers 10% returns on average


a year, why don't I just invest long term in SPXL because that's multiplying it by three and that would mean that I get around a 30% return per year over the long term. And the answer why you don't do that is basically volatility decay which means that this isn't actually how it works in practice. Now volatility decay is a complex term but essentially describes very simple maths and we can easily understand it by looking at these two examples. So imagine that you invest $100 into SP500. Now it goes down 20% in a year which leaves you with $80 but then over the next year it recovers 25% which gets you back to the $100. So over two years you basically broke even through a move of 20% down and then 25% up. Now if you imagine investing that $100 into a 3x ETF then SPX went down 20% in that first year but your 3x ETF went down 60% which means that from the $100 you're left with $40. Now the next year S&P went up 25% and your 3x ETF went up by 75% but it went up by 75% of the 40% which left you with still just $70. So whereas over the two years in the S&P500 you were able to break even, due to the leverage over the two years with the 3x ETF you are still down 30%. Basically it's simply the fact that when you make large losses and have large drawdowns it requires a much bigger move to the upside in order to break you even which is why basically these leveraged products can be a little bit problematic in bear markets and they can be a little bit problematic in choppy markets because these are the markets where they have drawdowns. You're going to have larger exacerbated drawdowns due to the leverage and that's going to require a bigger upside move in order to get you to break even which basically puts you in a hole that's harder to come out of. So clearly then the best thing is to invest into the leveraged ETF when it's not a bear market or it's not a choppy market which means that it's an upward positive trending market. Now this year for example would be a good example of that. If you look like this year yeah you've had a couple of corrections you had one in April you had one in August and you've got maybe a tiny one now but the S&P 500 was able to deliver you a 24% return. Now if you are using leverage there then you're able to exacerbate that strong positive trend and make around 64% return on the 3x ETF. So basically the leveraged ETF products work very well when the market is trending strongly and is not choppy without much direction and is certainly not trending downwards. That's when the leveraged ETF can land you in a little bit of trouble. So essentially the question is how do I find the markets where it's trending upwards so that I can invest in the leveraged ETFs whilst avoiding the markets that are choppy or downward trending so that I can avoid investing in the leveraged ETF at those times. Now some people may argue that the best way to find the trending market is to look at the moving averages. Now the idea there is that if the price is trending is trading above the moving averages then that's a signal that the market is in a positive trend and that's when someone might say I'm not saying this but someone might say that's the time to use the leveraged ETF. Now it's actually not the best way to identify a positive trending market. The reason why is that moving averages are a lagging indicator and that by the time the price has crossed below the moving average it's clear it's already gone into the bear trend or has gone into the downward trend and so you've caught yourself up in a sell-off already. Whereas there are instruments out there that are much more forward-looking and can help to pre-empt and you know sniff out these potential changes in dynamics in the market and that's what we want to use. Now if you look at 2008 for instance actually just before the crash the market was trading at all-time highs so it was way above all the moving averages so someone who was trading on the moving averages would have continued trading with leverage and they would have got absolutely screwed in this massive sell-off but what if there was something out there that could help to sniff out this massive sell-off before it happened and the way to do that is to use the credit spreads. Now credit spreads are forward-looking instruments which means that they're trying to sniff out something before it happens and what it's trying to sniff out essentially is signs of stress on the economy or on the market before they actually rear their ugly head and force price action to break down. When credit spreads are low or tight so you have a very low number on the credit spreads that's a good thing that means that there's very little risk there's very little stress in the economy and that's almost always correlated with a positive trend in the market which is exactly what we are looking for when we're investing into the leverage ETF but when credit spreads rise and they are quite wide this means that there's an increase in stress in the economy and this sometimes quite often actually leads to choppy and downward markets which is what we want to avoid so we're basically looking to avoid times when the credit spreads are quite wide and are rising and we're looking to capitalize on times when the credit spreads are low but the question is how do you know when credit spreads have risen so much that it signals that a bear market or a choppy market is coming because if you look at the chart here credit spreads did rise in August this is this year by the way so this is 2024 obviously with August we did have this you know carry trade thing going on credit spreads did rise but they didn't rise enough to signal to us that a bear market's coming or that we're going to face a massive choppy market in fact they they didn't break out of the bull market trend or the positive trend that we want to capitalize on which means that the the credit spreads rose but not enough to signal signal great alarm to us so the question then is how do I know when the credit spread has risen enough here it didn't rise enough for me to think okay let me get out of all my positions and not trade with leverage how do I know when is the time to capitalize and the time to avoid well through experience and research I figured out that basically the following triggers work exceptionally well for teaching us or signaling to us when to avoid the markets with leverage or indeed just even to scale down your positions if you're not using leverage or to you know this is the time that you want to capitalize and what the signals are is that okay when credit spreads rise 40% from their recent lows and I'm going to show you this when they rise 40% from their recent lows and cross above the 330 day exponential moving average that's a sign that you want to get out basically that's a sign that there's quite a very strong likelihood that you're going to see a choppy or downward trending market very soon that's the time when you want to be exiting your positions scaling out of your positions if you're not using leverage and if you are using leverage you just want to be exiting your positions and taking your profits now when do I want to be trading in the market well or potentially jumping back into the market after I've sold my positions previously well when credit spreads fall 35% from their recent highs that's normally a signal that the market will once again start trending up into that positive trend that we're looking to capitalize on so yeah what I'm going to do now is I'm going to dip into trading view to show you the credit spreads and to try and show you this in real in real time really so look this is the this is what I'm using in trading view to try and signal credit spreads now on the bloomberg terminal there is more there is more live data this is slightly lagged but it's still fine for the purposes of the strategy and I've tested it with this so I know that for sure and this one actually goes back to around 1999 but on bloomberg you can go much further than that but but for retail traders this is what you'll probably have available to you for tracking credit spreads and it's actually it's actually fine so uh let's just get into this so I'm just trying to scroll uh through now by the way what's what the ticker is uh is this so I actually just literally have um it saves as a favorite so this is the ticker uh it's a random string of like letters and stuff but you can just kind of note that down and save that on your trading view so that you can see now look this is how I'm looking at the credit spreads to try and identify the times when the credit spreads are going up to signal that I need to get out or coming down to signal that it's time for me to get back in so here I'm looking at as I mentioned so if we see the presentation again we're looking at times when credit spreads rise 40 percent from their recent lows and cross above the 330 day exponential moving average so the first thing I did get rid of that one I don't need that one is just map out the 330 day exponential


moving average. Now when it's risen 40% from the recent lows so you know I've identified the recent low here because if I go back further this is March 1998 if I go back further that's October 1997 that's more than six months before so potentially that's not the recent low that's a little bit past what's the recent low but you could even use this and you would get a similar kind of conclusion but if I use the low from here I'm looking for 40% up for me to be like yeah now that's that's time for me to get out of the position so here it's only up 26% so throughout all this time I will still be trading leaving the position running there's no issue with it we're looking for here okay so this is the point now where it's up 40% from the recent low so on this day here which is what we can see is the 18th of August 1998 this is the time when you know I need to be exiting my leverage position and basically sitting out of the market now you know the credit spreads continue to go up which tells us that the market is pricing in more stress more risk into the market now this is actually a local high so I'm basic for me to get back in I'm looking for credit spreads to fall 35% from their recent highs this is a recent high so I'm looking for 35% from here but you can see around 35% which is around here more or less it didn't come like this didn't go down 35% so I would still be sitting out because this hasn't executed on my trigger to get back in which is a 35% fall in the credit spreads so you know I would still be sitting out throughout all of this sitting out throughout all of this now you know I've got another recent high here I'm looking for 35% down from here now and you know you can see I still haven't got that like the credit spreads have come down but they haven't come down 35% from their recent highest so I am still sitting out throughout all of this yeah I've sat out for a few years here but you're gonna see on the chart on the S&P 500 that what I've set out basically is the dot-com bubble that bear market that came in the 2000s like I've sat that all out because credit spreads have signaled to me to get out and it hasn't yet signaled to me to get back in which yeah it seems to me seems to you perhaps that you know you've sat out for quite a number of years but why would you not want to sit out those years where it's literally a bear market after the dot-com bust so here's another local high and I'm looking for 35% down from here now to sort of see when I can get back in and that's this level here that I'm looking for and you can see I actually do get it so credit spreads from you know October to April 2003 they do fall by 35% so this here the 3rd of April 2003 would be the day when I want to get back into the market so that's where I'm gonna buy the leverage ETF again and by the way when I'm saying I'm gonna buy it you're going to full port that thing so you're gonna just buy it with the entire of your portfolio so a hundred percent invested into the into the into the leverage ETF now why are you going a hundred percent and not scaling in well one for simplicity and two because you've identified that this is now about to be a positive trending market so there's no point leaving some of your cash and cash reserve we've just set out for four years or five years waiting for a four years really for a bear market for a positive trend to be established now that you've got one you want to capitalize on that with all the cash that you have so yeah you would basically go full portfolio in this now credit spreads continue to fall which is great this means that you know you're in a positive trending market you're leaving your position running so it's been running for a couple of years now you're racking up the gains which is great and what we're looking for again now that you're in is again the signal to get out which is that credit spreads need to rise 40% from their recent lows and cross above the 330 day moving average if you get that then it's like okay parties over I need to get out I need to sell this position entirely and that's basically what you're looking for so it's about all of this I'm looking for it to go up 40% no didn't go up 40% just 21% so it's fine I'm still in and here I get another recent low okay and there it actually does go up by 40% it hasn't actually crossed the 330 day moving average so I'm like okay I'm still in but here it does it crosses the 330 day moving average and is up more than 40% so this is the day where I'm like yeah no let's get out so 14th of April 2005 that's where I finally sell my leverage ETF position and I'm gonna sit in cash again now again I'm sitting in cash so what I'm looking for is the signal to get back in which is when credit spreads for 35% from their recent highs that means that I'm good to go so here's a recent high and I'm looking for it to fall 35% so once it gets to around this level that's that's my signal to sort of get back in well it hasn't till now but eventually it does you know around here so on the 4th of May 2006 that's where credit spreads have fallen 35% from their recent highs and that's the time for you to basically jump back in and you're gonna again full port the leverage ETF with your entire portfolio and you're just gonna basically sit on it now you're in a positive trending market again that's what this means because you've got the signal that the credit spreads have fallen sufficiently that you're now confident you're in a positive trending market and so you can basically leave the position running the credit spreads go up a bit but you're again looking for it to go up 40% and here it doesn't it only goes up 24% so you leave the position running and here at this point this is where you get another low and boom there you are up 40% from the lows on the credit spread so this is your signal get out so you were in from here and you were out here so you were in and out within you know a year and a half or just over a year so now at this point you're sitting in cash now look at the date 2007 remember that the the big recession came in 2008 so here credit spreads have just told you sit in cash do not buy leverage ETF if you're not even buying leverage ETF and your strategy is just completely different to this it's still telling you just scale down your positions raise more cash this is time to go risk averse you do not need to be stressing out and you know from this point on where's we're comfortable we're just sitting in cash we're just watching the show happen and what we see is just credit spreads just go crazy right this is the 2008 Great Recession it just yeah it just goes crazy and for all of this markets obviously trending down it's like crashing basically and all of this you're sitting so pretty because you're like well I just sold all of my stuff because credit spreads told me to get out and you're just waiting for entry really you're waiting for a positive trend to basically be established again and so you're again looking for this signal 35% down from the recent highs well here you have a recent high we're looking for 35% down and boom it's around here so when do I get that triggering it's literally here so you get a triggering in April 2009 so from July 2007 to April 2009 you were sitting in cash you literally just saw the bear market happen and you did not lose anything because you were ahead of the time you were already sniffing out what was happening through the use of credit spreads now credit spreads continue to go you're now in by the way you full ported the leverage ETF at this time because you're confident now positive trend has just been established and it just credit spreads go down down down you're riding this positive market it's absolutely brilliant your leverage ETF is doing very well because you're in a positive trending market and all the time you're basically just thinking to yourself let me keep watching credit spreads because I need to understand when it's time for me to now get out and the signal to get out remember is to rise 40% from recent lows and to cross the 330 day moving average well here we have some recent lows here we actually have some recent lows so let's see did we get it we didn't it only rose 35% not 40% so I'm like okay I'm still gonna stay in and keep my leverage ETF investment going and here we have another recent low and 40% up would be this point here which we do get so on you know the 9th of August 2011 we do get that trigger so we would again be sitting in cash we would sell out of our leverage ETF entirely and sit in cash and wait for the trigger to get back in here we have a recent high so we're looking for 35% from the recent high in order to trigger the signal for you to get back in and we don't get it yet we don't get it yet 35% is around here so we get it finally here so on you know the 16th of February 2012 that's when you're like okay let me get back in and buy the leverage ETF with the entirety of my portfolio and you know you see credit spares just continue to trend lower they're very low for a number of years here you you leave the position running


and you basically make gains and you're all the time looking for the signal to get out and here you see it happen now i think we've made clear exactly what you're doing you would see here various times when you know you're out here you're looking for it to fall 35 you get back in here and then you're looking for the rise again oops you're going to be out here and so you're in out in out right um and this is this is basically the how you decide with the strategy to buy or to sell now what i want you to understand is if we map out all of these dates so the in out dates um so starting from uh here for instance so we got out on you know the 14th of august 1998 which is here 14th of august 1998 was the date when you got out now when did you get back in well obviously we were looking for the trigger of it going down 35 we got back in around here so diet of april 2003 um yeah third of april 2003 so all i've done here is i've literally put in all of the dates when the credit spreads told you to stay out so it told you to stay out from the period of august 1998 to the 3rd of april 2003 uh which is what we saw here now it told you to stay in here so when did it tell you to get out again when it told you to get out again on you know the 15th of april 2005 which is what i've got here 14th of april 2005 and when did it tell you to get back in well it told you to get back in here on the 5th of may 2006 um which you see uh here 11th of may 2006 it's because i'm uh quite zoomed out that i'm you know missing the days a little bit here um but if we look at what credit spreads told us to do with regards to staying out of the market um then these are all the dates when the credit spreads signal to us that this is not when we want to be trading in leverage etfs now we can easily deduce by filling the gaps when which periods of time the credit spreads told us to essentially continue trading to be in the market so if it was telling us to be out until the 3rd of april 2003 it means that it told us to get in on the 4th of april 2003 and to stay in until the 13th of april 2005 because on the 14th of april 2005 is when the trigger came to get back out so we can see that you know it told you to stay in from the 4th of april 2003 to the 13th of april 2005 and then when would it tell you to get back in again after this period well from the 12th of may 2006 until the 19th of july 2007 which we see here this is now the period when you're trading in the market so these are the periods that are of interest really because these are the times when you actually are in the market these are the times when you're out the market now what i want to show you here is what the power of these credit spreads are in predicting the direction of the market okay so what we're going to do is we're going to look at the graph for spx and i've already mapped out all of the different periods when it told you to stay in and to stay out of the market and what i want you to see is it's going to be perfectly apparent to you so look this is modern day and we'll take it all the way back okay so green is obviously where it told you to stay in the market red is where it told you to get out the market okay simple and all when i'm saying it told you to get out and in the market i'm obviously just talking about these triggers okay so look it told you to get in the market here clearly a very positive trend right that's when we want to be in leverage gts a very positive trend told you to stay out the market here excuse me i'm just going to take some water the credit spreads told me to stay out the market here and what do we see just a very choppy market this is not where you want to be using leverage gtf this is where we're going to face volatility decay this is not ideal it told me to stay in the market here again clear positive trending market it told me to come out the market here i mean bear market yeah bounce but clear bear market it told me to stay in the market here short positive trending market it told me to stay out the market here and actually we got a positive trending market so yeah it kind of made a mistake here but it's no big deal over the course of a long term right uh it still helped you to catch the bulk of the move uh because this was a period where it told you to stay in the market clear positive trend um here it told you to stay out the market quite choppy sideways movement not when you want to be using leverage etfs here it told you to stay in the market clear positive trend leverage etf works great um now i'm just going to take it back what you're clearly seeing is that every time it tells you to get in the market it's a positive trend positive trend positive trend positive trend we can take it all the way back it's just all positive trends when it tells you to get in the market now here look this is 2008 it told you to stay out the market look when it told you to stay out the market it got you out the market before the bear market even happened and then you rode you just sat out the entire bear market and jumped back in when the bear market was done because credit spreads told you all of this and you know we can take it all the way back again it told you to jump in very positive trend here look this is the uh you know the dot com sort of scenario it told you to jump out the market here potentially it told you to jump out a little bit early but it's fine because over the course of these this kind of five years it's clearly just a chop like a massive chop um it goes up then comes down and and you avoided it all you just sat out you just sort of focused on other things worked raised cash to add to your portfolio ready for the time when it told you to jump back in so you can see how effective the credit spreads are here because they've literally identified all the times when the market is about to trend positively and the leverage etf investment is going to work really well so credit spreads are the way to go when it comes to like uh predicting what the market is going to do now um or predicting when to use the leverage etf product now what i've done next is so i'm going to actually demonstrate this on sso uh i told you that i used 3x leverage etfs and you could use it here as well for even greater results it's going to be like amazing results with 3x leverage etf because you're literally catching positive trends every time with 3x leverage it's just going to be laughably great right here i've chosen to use sso and it's not because i'm scared to use 3x leverage sso is a 2x leverage product but the reason why i use the 2x leverage product rather than a 3x leverage product is because sso goes back to 2006 whereas 3x leverage products kind of came out in 2009 and i wanted to demonstrate this over the course of a longer period of time uh all the way back throughout the you know the 2008 kind of bear market so that's why i've used sso here for the sake of the example but you could easily do the back test and execute this strategy going forward with the 3x leverage etf and it's going to be even better results i just am not showing you that one because i don't have enough data going back to be able to show you it how it performs throughout 2008 okay so that's why i've used sso now look i've basically separated all of these times when the credit spreads told us this is when you want to be in the market right and i've i've listed them all out separately now what we're going to do is we're just going to go through sso and we're going to map out what the price was when it told you to jump in and what the price was when it told you to get out and then we can obviously through that see what the return was that the investment delivered you so we'll talk we'll go backwards so i know here i've got recent uh all the way down to um the initial period um but we'll start with the initial period because i've already decided to scroll through here i don't know why um so look it told me to jump in when was the date that it told me to jump in so the credit spreads told me to get in on the 30th of april 2009 and it told me to stay in until august 4th of august 2011 so 30th of april 2009 we're looking for that and we have it around here so the price was 297 and how i'm seeing that its price was 297 as i'm looking at the top next to where it says the ticker and the full name of the the instrument and it says 297 which is why i've written here uh i made a mistake there but we can say 297 cool um and on the 4th of august 2011 it told me to get out so i'm looking for the price then and uh we have a third and fifth so obviously it was over sort of a weekend or a closed day 543 okay so 543 so it told me to jump in at 297 and get out at 543 and remember this is a 2x leverage so if you're on a 3x leverage the gain here would be even bigger but what was the gain well we have um oops sorry 543 297 so the gain is an 82 percent gain um right here so i've written 79 82 percent gain so you literally made 1.82 x your money throughout


this period. Now from the 5th of August 2011 right up until March 2012 it was telling you to sit out of the market. So you weren't making anything, you weren't losing anything, you were just sitting in cash waiting to get going again in the market. So it next told you to jump into the market on the 13th of March 2012. So what was the price on the 13th of March 2012? Let's have a look. So you have 12th and 14th. So you have 13th is missing again but it's fine we'll use 14th. 7th, 17th. So that was the price when it told you to get in to the investment and it told you to get out on the 9th of October 2014. So let's see what it was trading at on the 9th of October 2014. It was trading at around 13.74. So here we basically have a return of, so 13.74 divided by 7th. A return of 92% here. So not quite there. I'm not sure where these numbers came from to be honest. I obviously made a bit of a mistake previously but it will still show you an amazing return. 1.92 money throughout this period. Now obviously again if you have 3x leverage in this it would be much more. It would be like astronomically good but it's fine for the sake of this example we're using 2x leverage which is fine. So then we're going to look at the 12th of July 2016. That was the next time when it told you to jump in. So 12th of July 2016 was this price here which was 17.45. So here 17.45 is when it told me to jump in. That was the price when I jumped in and the 5th of December 2018 is when I jumped out and that was around here basically 27.07. So we did basically from 27.07 17.45. So here we made a 55% return in that period. So we did 1.55x your money in this period. Now again we were sitting out for what was basically a year here. Almost more than a year which is fine. Like over the course of the long term it's not a problem. Obviously we're sitting out in a bear market or a very choppy market where it wouldn't have made much sense for you to be invested anyway especially not with leverage. So that's fine. We're trusting the credit spreads and we basically jump back in on the 13th of December 2019. So we're looking for 13th of December 2019 here and we basically find that it's trading at 36.36. Great 36.36 and on the 26th of February 2020 is when it told you to get out. So 26th of February 2020 it told you to get out at the price of 35.03. So here you've actually made a small loss in this period. You made a 3% loss in the period but it's no big deal because what you've basically avoided is this massive crash here. You see you were out here, you avoided this massive crash, so credit spreads did as good a job as they possibly could. You just got out with a very small loss which is absolutely fine when you consider you're on leverage. So you sat out until 21st of May 2020. That's when the positive trend was re-established and credit spreads told you that it would be so. So you basically jump back in here and what was the date that we were looking for again? 21st of May 2020. So we've got that here 28.54 is the price that it was trading at and we got out on the 14th of March 2022. So we were looking for 14th of March 2022 and so you got out on the price of 55.75, 55.75. So the gain here was 55.75 divided by 28.54 which was a 95% gain here. So this is slightly wrong, 95% here. So you made 1.95 extra money and then we have the last one, the last period where you invested which was 15th of July 2023. So you jumped in here on the 15th of July which was 59.97, 59.97 and you jumped out at what was essentially where you're not even out yet and the strategy you're still going. So 96.21, 96.21 and so in this period you made 96.21, 59.97. So you made a return of 60%, 60.4%. So you did 1.604 times your money. Now in that period before 2009 which was the bear market, if you remember it had us during 2007 to 2009 sitting out of the market which was ideal and that's why throughout this period here you were not invested. So you basically didn't make any gain or a loss. So now imagine that in this period of July 2007, so we're going to start in July 2007, you had £10,000. Now you didn't actually make any investment until the 30th of April 2009 because credit spreads told you you need to sit out. This is not a positive trending market that you need to be invested in. But let's see what £10,000 invested in July 2007 gets you by the time you get to 2024. So you start with £10,000 and you're going to initially make 1.82 your money and then in the next round of investing you're going to make 1.92 that money and then you're going to make 1.55 that money. Then you make a small loss remember so that's what you're left with after that small loss and then you make 1.95 that money and then you make 1.64 that money. So your £10,000 at the end of the period is equal to this. So let's just scale this so I can do it very easily. So at the end you're left with 163,651. So quite literally you have done 16.3x your money and that's with a 2x ETF. Now imagine you had a 3x ETF you would be making even more than that. In fact you'll be making about you know 16.3 times 1.5 probably around 25% your money, 25 times your money sorry. Now let's compare that to what the S&P did in the period since July 2007. Well in July 2007 it was trading at around 1,553. Today it's trading at what it says here 5,906. So in that period investing in SPX delivered you a gain of 5,906 divided by 1,553, 3.8x your money. So my strategy has delivered you 16 times your money versus what the S&P would have delivered you 4 times your money and if you had used 3x ETF you would have made 25x your money in a period 25x your money in a period where the S&P delivered you 4x your money and that was with you sitting out large periods of time and that's fine because over the long term you're looking at what the final result is and the result is extremely attractive. Anybody can beat the market very easily with a strategy like this. Now there are some fees associated with the ETF I'm not denying it's going to eat into that number a bit but you are blowing past the market absolutely destroying the market you're destroying all the hedge funds and it's such a simple strategy. Use the credit spreads. Credit spreads are extremely effective even if you're not using the leverage strategy still look at credit spreads because they will tell you when you need to be in the market and when you need to be out the market. This is one of the best strategies a very effective strategy. If I were you I would be looking to wait for the signal to get out which will probably come next year with the hawkish Fed because credit spreads will rise and then look for the signal again to jump back in and just execute the strategy. Have what could be a large proportion of your portfolio invested in this.


and then have a smaller part of the portfolio which you day trade with or you trade swing trade with or whatever and if you're struggling entirely with trading just use this strategy okay all right thanks guys I know it's a long video but I appreciate you and I hope that this video has helped okay all right thanks guys you
