# ATLAS Crypto Monitoring - Session Startup

**Current Session:** CRYPTO-MONITOR-1
**Last Session:** EQUITY-30 (December 21, 2025)
**Focus:** Live monitoring of crypto STRAT daemon

---

## Session Objective

Monitor the crypto daemon in real-time to:
1. Validate pattern classifications against actual bar data
2. Verify entry correctness when trades trigger
3. Flag missed opportunities (pattern → no trade)
4. Check for equity bugs in crypto code

---

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Check daemon is running
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251 "sudo systemctl status atlas-crypto-daemon --no-pager | head -15"

# Start monitoring logs
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251 "sudo journalctl -u atlas-crypto-daemon -f --no-pager"

# Get recent signals
ssh atlas@178.156.223.251 "sudo journalctl -u atlas-crypto-daemon --since '10 minutes ago' --no-pager | grep 'NEW SIGNAL'"
```

---

## Critical: Invoke strat-methodology Skill

**MANDATORY** for any STRAT pattern analysis. The skill has been updated with:
- Three Universal Truths
- Intrabar Classification rules
- "Let the Market Breathe" timing (not applicable to 24/7 crypto, but reference for methodology)

---

## Known Issues to Monitor

### 1. Signal Expiration Bug (CRITICAL)

SETUP signals expire in ~60 seconds, not enough time for triggers.

**Watch for:**
```
Added signal to monitor: BIP... [SETUP]
Removed X expired signals       <-- How fast?
```

### 2. Trigger vs Execution Gap

64 triggers but only 6 executions. Why are 58 not becoming trades?

### 3. Pattern Accuracy

Verify COMPLETED patterns match actual bar sequence.

---

## Event Response Protocol

### When NEW SIGNAL [COMPLETED] appears:

1. Note: symbol, timeframe, pattern, direction
2. Fetch price data (if needed for verification)
3. Check: Does pattern match actual bar types?
4. Log finding in CRYPTO_HANDOFF.md

### When TRIGGER FIRED appears:

1. Note: trigger price vs current price
2. Check: Is entry direction correct per STRAT?
3. Log in CRYPTO_HANDOFF.md

### When TARGET/STOP HIT appears:

1. Log the trade result
2. Calculate if R:R was correct
3. Note any discrepancies

### When signals expire without trigger:

1. Flag as potential missed opportunity
2. Check if price broke trigger level after expiration
3. Document in CRYPTO_HANDOFF.md
