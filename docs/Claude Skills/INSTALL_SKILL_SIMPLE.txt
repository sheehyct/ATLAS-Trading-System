# Copy-Paste This Into Claude Code to Install STRAT Skill

---

Please help me install the STRAT methodology skill. Follow these steps:

**Step 1: Create the skill directory**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Step 2: Create SKILL.md file**
Create `~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology/SKILL.md` with this structure:

```yaml
---
name: strat-methodology
description: Implements STRAT trading methodology with bar classification (Type 1/2U/2D/3), pattern detection (2-1-2, 3-1-2, 2-2, Rev Strats), timeframe continuity (4 C's, MOAF, institutional flips), entry/exit mechanics, position management, and options integration. Use when building algorithmic trading systems, detecting STRAT patterns, calculating mechanical entries, implementing multi-timeframe analysis, managing positions, or integrating options with technical patterns. Requires VectorBT PRO for backtesting.

# STRAT Trading Methodology

[ADD YOUR FULL STRAT SKILL CONTENT HERE]
```

**Step 3: Verify installation**
```bash
# Check file exists
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology/SKILL.md

# View frontmatter
head -n 10 ~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology/SKILL.md

# Check file size
wc -l ~/.claude/skills/strat-methodology/SKILL.md
```

**Step 4: Confirm the skill is ready**
Tell me when:
1. Directory is created
2. SKILL.md exists with valid YAML frontmatter
3. Content is added
4. File size is reasonable (not empty)

Then I'll be able to use this skill automatically when you detect STRAT-related requests.

**Note:** After installation, the skill will auto-trigger when I ask about STRAT methodology, bar classification, pattern detection, VectorBT Pro implementation, or algorithmic trading.
