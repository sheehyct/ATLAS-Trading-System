Please read the following documents and utilize open memory queries for context of this session's development. We are to maintain our standard professional development workflow. For any STRAT related concepts, development, changes, or additions the use of the strat-methodology skill is mandatory through the entire session. Not just in the initial plan stage. The use of the plugins in CLAUDE.md are also mandatory.

## Required Reading (in order)

2. C:\Users\sheeh\.claude\plans\quiet-floating-clarke.md (FULL PARALLEL PLAN)

## Parallel Development Context

This session is part of a **4-track parallel development effort** using git worktrees.

**THIS SESSION IS: STORY Track**
**BRANCH: docs/atlas-story**
**SCOPE: docs/story/ directory only - no code changes**
**TARGET AUDIENCE: Open source community**

## Deliverables Location

```
docs/story/
  - README.md (main narrative - could become repo README)
  - 01_INCEPTION.md (why we started, initial goals, vision)
  - 02_ARCHITECTURE_EVOLUTION.md (key design decisions, pivots)
  - 03_WHAT_WORKED.md (victories, successful patterns)
  - 04_WHAT_DIDNT.md (failures, archived approaches, lessons)
  - 05_RESEARCH_DEEP_DIVES.md (technical details, academic foundations)
  - 06_LESSONS_LEARNED.md (advice for others building trading systems)
```

## Critical Rules

1. **DOCS ONLY** - Only create/modify files in docs/story/
2. **NO CODE CHANGES** - This track produces narrative documentation only
3. **HANDOFF** - Create docs/session_handoffs/TRACK_STORY_SESSION_{N}.md

We are to prioritize accuracy over speed.
